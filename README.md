# Mod 2 Career Journal
You will use the prompts in this README to reflect on your Mod 2 projects.  The point of this career journal is to assist you in keeping track of the "story" of your Turing journey! When you start interviewing, writing your resume, and are fully on the job hunt, these details will be super handy for you to have. 

At the end of each project (eval days are great for this), carefully consider and fill out each project's reflection questions below.

## Set Up Instructions
- Create your own document to use for this career journal - your own private gist, a google doc, or another document of your choice.
- Copy/paste the prompts below from this README into that document.  If you are using a gist, you'll want to copy/paste the raw markdown from this README.  You can see that by clicking on the README.md file to open it, then selecting `Code` to see the markdown.
- After you've done that, please DM your instructors a link to your document.

### Solo Project Reflections

1. At the beginning of the project, what part(s) of the project were you most nervous about? At the end, do you feel those concerns were justified?
   - Felt slightly nervous about creating draggable elements, because it was something I have not done before but now looking back at it, it was no where near as complicated as I thought it was.

3. Describe one thing you got stuck on during the project. Based on that experience, have you made/do you plan to make any specific changes to the way you prepare for the next project?
   - I got stuck on the dragging more than I should've had. The solution was to try my own way which worked great. I guess the idea of not sticking to an idea too much if it doens't seem to work is something I should follow.
5. List 2-3 bullet points about your process and/or accomplishments from working on this project (things you could highlight on your resume).
   - Being able to learn typescript and incorporate it in less than 2 days
   - Being able to tackle a complex problem by following my own advice
