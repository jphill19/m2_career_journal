# Mod 2 Career Journal
You will use the prompts in this README to reflect on your Mod 2 projects.  The point of this career journal is to assist you in keeping track of the "story" of your Turing journey! When you start interviewing, writing your resume, and are fully on the job hunt, these details will be super handy for you to have. 

At the end of each project (eval days are great for this), carefully consider and fill out each project's reflection questions below.

## Set Up Instructions
- Create your own document to use for this career journal - your own private gist, a google doc, or another document of your choice.
- Copy/paste the prompts below from this README into that document.  If you are using a gist, you'll want to copy/paste the raw markdown from this README.  You can see that by clicking on the README.md file to open it, then selecting `Code` to see the markdown.
- After you've done that, please DM your instructors a link to your document.

### Solo Project Reflections

1. At the beginning of the project, what part(s) of the project were you most nervous about? At the end, do you feel those concerns were justified?
   - Felt slightly nervous about creating draggable elements, because it was something I have not done before but now looking back at it, it was no where near as complicated as I thought it was.

3. Describe one thing you got stuck on during the project. Based on that experience, have you made/do you plan to make any specific changes to the way you prepare for the next project?
   - I got stuck on the dragging more than I should've had. The solution was to try my own way which worked great. I guess the idea of not sticking to an idea too much if it doens't seem to work is something I should follow.
5. List 2-3 bullet points about your process and/or accomplishments from working on this project (things you could highlight on your resume).
   - Being able to learn typescript and incorporate it in less than 2 days
   - Being able to tackle a complex problem by following my own advice

### Paired Project Reflections

1. At the beginning of the project, what part(s) of the project were you most nervous about? At the end, do you feel those concerns were justified?
   - At the start, I was pretty nervous about the MVC architecture since it was my first time working with a Rails app. I wasn’t used to separating logic between the controller and model, and that process felt a bit overwhelming at first. Looking back, I’d say the concern was definitely justified, but as I got deeper into the project, I started to see the logic behind it. Once I got the hang of how everything fits together, it made a lot more sense.
3. Reflect on a time you and your partner got stuck. What was your process like? How did you communicate? How did you get unstuck?  What were your key takeaways from that experience?
   - We challenged ourselves to handle multiple query parameters in our request, but it turned out to be more complicated than expected. After running into some issues, we did research and found the Rails built-in scope method, which helped simplify things. We spent time practicing with it and solidifying our understanding of class methods. Our process involved a lot of back-and-forth communication, sharing what we found, and testing different approaches until we got it right. The key takeaway was how valuable research and collaboration are when tackling unfamiliar concepts.
5. Have you and your partner experienced any conflicts? What steps did you take to resolve it?
   - Me and Melchor worked really well. The man works hard and is determine on achieving a task. I have nothing but respect for him
7. List 2-3 bullet points about your process and/or accomplishments from working on this project (things you could highlight on your resume).
   - Quickly adapted to new technology, including Ruby on Rails, demonstrating the ability to learn and apply unfamiliar frameworks effectively.
   - Gained confidence with JSON architecture, specifically in structuring responses for both errors and successful outcomes (happy paths).
   - Developed strong problem-solving skills by facing challenges without immediate answers, utilizing research and persistence to find solutions.
9. What did you enjoy in this project that surprised you? Does it make you want to explore anything further?
   - I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed collaborating with someone who was equally invested and eager to learn. It makes me curious about what it would be like to work in a larger team with a fun and energetic culture.
11. What have you learned about yourself and your learning style from navigating pairing with a partner?
   - I've learned that I gain a lot from teaching. While working with scopes, I not only had to navigate the problem but also explain it to my partner, which solidified my understanding much more than just practicing alone."

### Group Project Reflections
   
    
1. At the beginning of the project, what part(s) of the project were you most nervous about? At the end, do you feel those concerns were justified?
   -  I was most nervous about setting up a process for delegating tasks to everyone and ensuring we could all complete our work on time. I generally prefer asynchronous work, as I find it challenging to be productive while working live with others
3. Reflect on a time you and your partner got stuck. What was your process like? How did you communicate? How did you get unstuck?  What were your key takeaways from that experience?
   - A member of my group couldn't solve an issue and resorted to using ChatGPT to generate a solution. During the code review, they struggled to explain what the submitted code did. At that point, I realized that having code we can't fully understand is not beneficial for the project, so we declined the pull request. We went back to the drawing board and researched the JSON app serializer documentation to learn how to pass optional arguments. We found similar code to what ChatGPT had generated and focused on understanding how it functioned. This experience taught me the importance of fully grasping the code we include in our project.
5. Have you and your teammates experienced any conflict? What steps did you take to resolve it?
   - The situation described in question 3 highlights a conflict we experienced. To resolve it, we chose not to accept the code and took it upon ourselves to research and understand the solution fully before implementing it. While I was upset, I didn't lash out. I’m sure I came across as frustrated, but I focused on controlling my emotions and gave feedback, advocating for only using code we fully understand.
7. List 2-3 bullet points about your process and/or accomplishments from working on this project (things you could highlight on your resume).
   - Leadership: I step up when teammates feel overwhelmed, taking charge to break down complex problems and help guide the team through uncertainty.
   - Technical Problem-Solving: While I may not always have immediate answers, I’m confident in my ability to figure things out. I’ve consistently jumped in to help debug technical issues and discovered solutions.
9. What did you enjoy in this project that surprised you? Does it make you want to explore anything further?
   - I really enjoyed working on the front end. I love the creativity that is involved ind designing a good front end, from artistic to UX design, it's very captivating and it's exactly why I wanted to become a developer.
11. What have you learned about yourself and your learning style from navigating working with a larger team?
   - I’ve learned the importance of establishing boundaries. For much of the project, I found myself helping others troubleshoot their tasks, and while I didn’t mind sacrificing for the sake of the team, it began to take a toll on my personal time. Moving forward, I realize I need to set stronger boundaries to balance supporting the team and maintaining my own productivity, especially in a real-world setting.

### Final Project Reflections

1. At the beginning of the project, what part(s) of the project were you most nervous about? At the end, do you feel those concerns were justified?
   - Honestly, I was nervous about the scale of the project. There were a lot of tasks to complete and very little time, so I feared I wouldn’t be able to finish everything. In the end, I not only completed the project a day early but also managed to implement all of the front-end extensions.
3. Describe one thing you got stuck on during the project. Based on that experience, have you made/do you plan to make any specific changes to the way you prepare for your future projects (intermission work, next inning's projects, etc)?
   - I got stuck on creating validations for Coupons to ensure they were only applied to the correct merchant's items. Initially, this seemed simple, but the relationships were more complex:
     - An` Item `belongs to a `Merchant` and has many `InvoiceItems`.
     - A `Coupon` belongs to a `Merchant` and has many `Invoices`.
     - An `Invoice` belongs to a `Coupon` and a `Customer `and has many `InvoiceItems.`
   - The challenge was figuring out where to place the validation, as there was almost a circular dependency in the relationships. I nearly got it right by creating logic to throw errors, but it didn’t fully prevent coupons from being applied to `Invoices` that contain `InvoiceItems` that didn't belong to the correct merchant. In the end, the validation needed to be on the `InvoiceItem `model since it’s the final part of the chain. Moving forward, I’ll be more mindful of this logical flow to create better validations.

5. List 2-3 bullet points about your process and/or accomplishments from working on this project (things you could highlight on your resume).
   - Developed complex Active Record queries
   - Implemented SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) design
